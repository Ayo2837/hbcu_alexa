# Let's Build an Alexa Skill

You will be building the your skill front-end using the Alexa Developer Console and its backend using Lambda in the AWS Management Console. 

### Tools

For this activity, you will need:
1. your Amazon.com account login - the one you use to shop on Amazon.com
2. an AWS Educate account (if you are a student) or a personal aws.amazon.com account

## Before You Start
Let's begin with an Alexa Skill theory crash course. Since we will get to building fairly quickly, there are a few things you should have high-level knowledge of:

- Basic Alexa Terminology
- Parts of an Alexa Skill
- Parts of a Voice Command
- Front-end - Interaction Model
- Backend - Hosted Service
